Usage
-----

1. Install plugin
2. Do things with it

This is one uncomplete plugin.
It was supposed to quantumize your server.
That means that weird things happen if you stare at a point long enough (Cows transforming into chickens, things cloning themselves randomly being quantum entangled and so on.)
However, the only thing it does atm is randomly putting glowstone blocks everywhere you look, AMAZING!!
